\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conc}


This method is not person independent. Training before using the system is essential for good performance. As expected SVM gives superior performance both in classification performance and time.


\section{Future work}
Do more work on a automated threshold, Implement SVM in Sonic Gesture. Sonic Gesture can use rewrite also.
