\section{The dataset}
The dataset consists of manually labeled recorded movies of 20 different people
performing the complete sequence of hand poses.

Usually the 12 Curwen solfege hand symbols are performed in front of the torso.
To increase the number of hand poses to be recogniced, all 12 Curwen are also
performed mirrored next to the body of the recorded subject.  Additionally four
extra hand symbols have been added that are not part of the Curwen sequence.
These last four symbols are performed next to the head.
