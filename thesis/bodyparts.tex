\section{Color space conversion}
Hue, Saturation and Intensity. Only hue and Saturation is used to make lightning intensity independent.

\section{Face detection - Haar classifier}
The hand pose chain stats with detecting a face in the first video frame. This is done using the haar classifier, a  boosted rejection cascade that is trained with Haar-like wavelet features\cite{Lienhart02anextended}.
Haar wavelets, histogram building.

\section{Skin color histogram}
When a face is found a color model for the subjects skin can be created. this is done by constructing a 2 dimensional histogram with the Hue and Saturation values. The optimal number of bins can't be exactly determined, a not to high or not to low value is important. 
Sonic Gesture used 180 bins for Hue and 256 for Saturation. \marginpar{EXPERIMENT WITH THIS}

\section{Blob detection}
Back projection, morphological transformations

\section{Pixel grouping, contour extraction}
join touching pixels

\section{Blob labeling}
Heuristics for blob labeling

\section{Blob label stabilization}
Kalman filter (prediction) and template search
