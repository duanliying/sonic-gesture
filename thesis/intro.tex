\section{The Human\-Computer Interface}


Human\-Computer Interaction is slow. The information per minute rate is still low nowadays, and innovation is progressing slowly. Since the introduction of the mouse in the seventies no revolutionary new peripherals where introduced that aid the communication with a computer. 

To get inspiration for improvement, one can look around and study already existing 'solutions', for example inter human communication. 

When two people are in a room and don't have a audio or visual limitation, they will probably communicate by speech. But there is much more going on than only producing and interpreting words. The intonation, speed and other small variations in the voice add a lot more information to the words. But also the facial expression and body language give more space for expression. Some people like to 'talk with their hands' while telling a story, something that also adds expression to the transmitted information.


\section{Sign Language}

A deaf person can't interpret spoken words, at least not by listening. He or she is highly depended on visual information. Sign languages have been created or invented to aid this visual communication. In these languages two elements have an important role, the face and the hands. These body parts give the most expressive power. The face because it is very good for expressing feelings and emotions, and the hands because they are very flexible and morphable. The hands are especially interesting because there are countless combinations of finger poses and orientations. 

Speech generation, speech recognition, facial expression recognition and sign language interpretation have all been studied before. Research has been done in automated sign language interpretation using computer vision\cite{Buehler2009}\cite{RichardBowden2004}. The problem with interpretating sign language is a ver large vocabulary, segmentation of the signs


\section{Goal and motivation}
The goal of this thesis is to describe the design, build and evaluation process of a system for hand pose recognition.

To realize this some criteria on the system's settings are required:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One person in the image
	\item Person is wearing clothing with long sleeves
	\item Good enough lightning conditions
	\item No skin like colors in the image.
\end{itemize}

The main goal is to increase the communication speed, but also introduce the possibility to add more 'feeling'Â to Human\-Computer Interaction, especially for real time interaction. Using hand poses for Computer aided music composing is interesting but challenging, since the realtime element plays an important role. Also, in a live performance setting, it is much more interesting to look at somebody using his body to interact with a machine than only click a mouse.


\section{Solfege, The Curwen Hand symbols}

For this experiment Sonic Gesture is trained with the Curwen Solfege set\cite{choksy1999}.
