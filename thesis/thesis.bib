  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel scale- and rotation-invariant interest
	point detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features).
	It approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with
	respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can
	be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying
	on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths
	of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using
	a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based
	descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This
	leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching
	steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation
	set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life
	object recognition application. Both show SURF’s strong performance.},

  abstract = {Many robotic applications work with visual reference maps, which usually
	consist of sets of more or less organized images. In these applications,
	there is a compromise between the density of reference data stored
	and the capacity to identify later the robot localization, when it
	is not exactly in the same position as one of the reference views.
	Here we propose the use of a recently developed feature, SURF, to
	improve the performance of appearance-based localization methods
	that perform image retrieval in large data sets. This feature is
	integrated with a vision-based algorithm that allows both topological
	and metric localization using omnidirectional images in a hierarchical
	approach. It uses pyramidal kernels for the topological localization
	and three-view geometric constraints for the metric one. Experiments
	with several omnidirectional images sets are shown, including comparisons
	with other typically used features (radial lines and SIFT). The advantages
	of this approach are proved, showing the use of SURF as the best
	compromise between efficiency and accuracy in the results.},

  abstract = {This article presents a novel approach to markerless real-time pose
	recognition in a multicamera setup. Body pose is retrieved using
	example-based classification based on Haar wavelet-like features
	to allow for real-time pose recognition. Average Neighborhood Margin
	Maximization (ANMM) is introduced as a powerful new technique to
	train Haar-like features. The rotation invariant approach is implemented
	for both 2D classification based on silhouettes, and 3D classification
	based on visual hulls.},

  abstract = {Skin color has proven to be a useful and robust cue for face detection,
	localization and tracking. Image content filtering, content aware
	video compression and image color balancing applications can also
	benefit from automatic detection of skin in images. Numerous techniques
	for skin color modelling and recognition have been proposed during
	several past years. A few papers comparing different approaches have
	been published [Zarit et al. 1999], [Terrillon et al. 2000], [Brand
	and Mason 2000]. However, a comprehensive survey on the topic is
	still missing. We try to fill this vacuum by reviewing most widely
	used methods and techniques and collecting their numerical evaluation
	results.},

  abstract = {We present an adaptive skin color model for hand gesture tracking
	which is applied to cross-modal analysis of planning meetings. We
	build a skin color model with the Gaussian distribution and a skin
	color filter for each participant in meetings. By combining with
	the vector coherence mapping (VCM) algorithm, we track hand motion
	and obtain 3D trajectories. The hand gesture stream is extracted
	from hand motion trajectories. Different skin color models are created
	for different people to handle the differences of skin color. We
	update each model dynamically to adapt changes of environments. A
	parallel system has been implemented to track and extract hand motion
	trajectories. Examples of hand motion gesture tracking in meeting
	environments are provided. The applications of the adaptive skin
	color model can increase the speed of hand tracking},
