  abstract = {Many robotic applications work with visual reference maps, which usually
	consist of sets of more or less organized images. In these applications,
	there is a compromise between the density of reference data stored
	and the capacity to identify later the robot localization, when it
	is not exactly in the same position as one of the reference views.
	Here we propose the use of a recently developed feature, SURF, to
	improve the performance of appearance-based localization methods
	that perform image retrieval in large data sets. This feature is
	integrated with a vision-based algorithm that allows both topological
	and metric localization using omnidirectional images in a hierarchical
	approach. It uses pyramidal kernels for the topological localization
	and three-view geometric constraints for the metric one. Experiments
	with several omnidirectional images sets are shown, including comparisons
	with other typically used features (radial lines and SIFT). The advantages
	of this approach are proved, showing the use of SURF as the best
	compromise between efficiency and accuracy in the results.},

  abstract = {We present an adaptive skin color model for hand gesture tracking
	which is applied to cross-modal analysis of planning meetings. We
	build a skin color model with the Gaussian distribution and a skin
	color filter for each participant in meetings. By combining with
	the vector coherence mapping (VCM) algorithm, we track hand motion
	and obtain 3D trajectories. The hand gesture stream is extracted
	from hand motion trajectories. Different skin color models are created
	for different people to handle the differences of skin color. We
	update each model dynamically to adapt changes of environments. A
	parallel system has been implemented to track and extract hand motion
	trajectories. Examples of hand motion gesture tracking in meeting
	environments are provided. The applications of the adaptive skin
	color model can increase the speed of hand tracking},
