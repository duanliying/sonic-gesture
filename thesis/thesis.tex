\chapter*{Abstract}
A real\-time method for estimating hand poses in video using a normal RGB camera is presented. The method uses a skin color distribution for pixel based limb localization and HOG features for classification. The performance of HOG is compared with SURF where HOG yielded superior performance. As classifiers $k$-NN and SVM with the RBF and $\chi^2$ kernels are evaluated, where SVM in combination with the $\chi^2$ kernel performed best. All evaluation is performed with a new constructed dataset consisting of 72 recordings of 20 people performing 28 hand symbols based upon the Curwen Solfege method. A prototype implementation translating in Open Sound Control is described, this to demonstrate the practical usability of the method in a real-time situation.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Until not so long ago I never dared dreaming to do this; writing the acknowledgments of my Master Thesis. I'm really proud I came this far and I'm really content with the subject and results of my research. It took a total of 9 months to finish the software, gather a dataset, read papers and write this thesis.I never worked on a project this long.

The Master at the University of Amsterdam was the most exciting but also most challenging time of my life. I would never have made it, without the help and inspiration I got from people in my surroundings. 

First of all I want to thank Ivo Everts, who gave up a lot of his time to supervise, motivate and inspire me. Countless cigarets where smoked during our weekly meetings, and I hope this will keep happen sometimes in the future.

I want to thank Maarten van Someren for helping me to bridge the gap between the Bachelor of Arts and the Master of Science. It was a difficult time and I really had to catch up with a lot of math and the scientific methodology back then. 

I want to thank my parents for supporting me financially and motivating me for so long, it would have been very difficult to do this Master without that help.

I want to thank Anne Schuth, Arjan Nusselder and Andr\{'}e van der Vlies for reviewing this thesis and giving valuable feedback.

I want to thanks my girlfriend Anouk H\{"}ovels - even though I think she has no clue what this thesis is about - always supported me, motivated me and helped me where she could.

I want to thank Anne Schuth, Arjan Nusselder, me, Ivo Everts, Jasper Stroomer, Peter, Hanne Nijhuis, Jasper 2, Ork de Rooi, Roberto Valenti, Xiron, Gosia, Hamdi, Michael, Sil Westerveld, Victoria, Bas van der Vlies, Koen, Chu and Stratis for participating in my dataset and I'm sorry if I didn't remember your surname. 

I want to thank Intel for making OpenCV open source, it is a great library and it will be even better in the near future. 

and finally, I want to thank everybody who I forgot, everybody that gave me good idea's and tips for Sonic Gesture.
